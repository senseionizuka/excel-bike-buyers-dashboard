Bike Buyers Excel Dashboard Project
Project Overview

This project was created as a practice and learning exercise to develop foundational skills in data analysis and dashboard creation using Microsoft Excel.

The project analyzes customer data to understand bike purchasing behavior based on factors such as age, income, gender, region, and commute distance.
The objective is to explore patterns and insights that help determine which customer segments are more likely to purchase a bike.

The entire analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on data cleaning, pivot tables, and interactive dashboard creation.
